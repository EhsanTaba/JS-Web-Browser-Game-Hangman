Hangman Web Browser Game
The objective of the game is to guess the generated word based on the category you choose.
If you fail to choose the correct letters six times the game ends and you lose.
If you succeed at choosing the correct letters you will not add to the hang man.
If you get some letters wrong you will have parts of the hangman hanging but if you guess the correct letters before all of the parts are hanging you will still win the game.
